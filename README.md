###[Falsy Bouncer](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/basic-algorithm-scripting/falsy-bouncer)

## PROBLEM EXPLANATION
Remove all falsy values from an array.

## HINTS
### Hints 1
Falsy is something which evaluates to FALSE.  There are only six falsy values in JavaScript: undefined, null, NaN, 0, "" (empty string), and false of course.
### Hints 2
We need to make sure we have all the falsy values to compare, we can know it, maybe with a function with all the falsy values.
### Hints 3
Then we need to add `filter()` withthe falsy values function...
